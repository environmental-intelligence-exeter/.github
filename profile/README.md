## EI Exeter ðŸ‘‹

At the University of Exeter we undertake cutting-edge research at the interface of Environment & Sustainability Science and Data Science & Artificial Intelligence. We utilise cutting edge digital technologies to gain insight into our impact on the environment and use this to develop strategies to mitigate or reverse the effects of climate change.

We work collaboratively with industry, policy makers and conservation agencies to translate research insights into real world impacts, with a particular emphasis on cross-departmental and solution-focussed research programmes, as we work towards net zero.

We develop the next generation of Environmental Intelligence scientists through research-led teaching in the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Environmental Intelligence, and collaborate with world leading research organisations the Met Office, through the Joint Centre for Excellence in Environmental intelligence, and the Alan Turing Institute, via the Exeter led special interest group in Environment and Sustainability.

We proactively develop and manage business relationships with a wide range of partners. Please get in contact to discuss how we can help your organisation meet its environmental ambitions.
